We encourage students to build practical experiments. We help them with guidance 
and expenses needed to build them. Through this initiative, upto 20 experiments built
by students are supported by the Science Centre. All these experiments will be showcased
at the Science Centre Museum.

Get in touch with us about your experiment ideas. Please elaborate the details
of the experiment (title, aim, objective, principle, materials needed) in a document
and attach it in email.
