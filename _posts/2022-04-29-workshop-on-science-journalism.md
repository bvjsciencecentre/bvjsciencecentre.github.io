            <h2>About The Event</h2>
            <p>“Science values detail, precision, the impersonal, the technical, the lasting, facts, numbers and being right. Journalism values brevity, approximation, the personal, the colloquial, the immediate, stories, words and being right now.” Quentin Cooper made this statement on Material World, a BBC Radio science program, almost a decade ago. Although symbiotic, the relationship between scientists and journalists becomes 'tense' when science leaves the pages of technical journals and finds itself addressing the realm of the general public. From fundamental concepts like the greenhouse effect to discussions on emerging research on COVID-19 strains, science needs to be communicated to the masses, at which point it enters the ambit of journalism.</p>
